      `The Portal Network is an in progess effort to enable lightweight protocol access by resource constrained devices. The term "portal" is used to indicate that these networks provide a view into the protocol but are not critical to the operation of the core Ethereum protocol.`,
      `The Portal Network is comprised of multiple peer-to-peer networks which together provide the data and functionality necessary to expose the standard JSON-RPC API. These networks are specially designed to ensure that clients participating in these networks can do so with minimal expenditure of networking bandwidth, CPU, RAM, and HDD resources.`,

      "Transactions which are part of this network's gossip are able to be validated without access to the Ethereum state. This is accomplished by bundling a proof which includes the account balance and nonce for the transaction sender. This validation is required to prevent DOS attacks.",
      'This network is a pure gossip network and does not implement any form of content lookup or retrieval.',
    ],
    'Header Gossip Network': [
      'The Header Gossip Network faciliates tracking and following the canonical chain of block headers.',
      "A double batched merkle log accumulator is used to minimize storage overhead while still allowing nodes to verify the historical headers without requiring nodes to store the full history. The network also exposes functionality to allow new nodes joining the network to acquire a copy of another node's accumulator.",
